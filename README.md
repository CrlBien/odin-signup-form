# Sign up Page

A Sign up Page, the first project for The Odin Project's Fullstack JavaScript module. This is a sign up page for a website called [Eduk.](https://crlbien.github.io/odin-signup-form/) which is an online learning platform. Built with pure HTML/CSS which means it doesn't have any validations using Javascript.
